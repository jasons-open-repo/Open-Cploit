Yes, the exploit is incompatible with the
release of the new release of the roblox 
launcher. The code of the launcher's lua
extension has been updated and I think there's
still no exploit that could bypass and add
extra lua codes to the roblox client.
I didn't exploit in a while so I don't 
know that much but if the injection 
doesn't work, it's most likely the issue of a 
outdated exploit that can't handle the new
code. Sorry if this doesn't work for you,
You could still download older clients from a place
called the internet.
